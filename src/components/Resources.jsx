                            We take the safety and well-being of our clients very seriously. We have protocols

                            practices, and we regularly monitor the care being provided.

                            Unfortunately, we do not provide medical care, as we are a home care agency and not a home
                            health agency. The tasks of a home health aide are not drastically different from that of
                            a caregiver, but our staff is not required to have the additional medical training outside
                            of basic life support and emergency procedure training. Although we can't provide these
                            services to you directly we can refer you to the right location.

                            these situations.

                            more than happy to re-assess needs and try something different.
